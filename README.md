# rainfall-Average
#by Nazareth Villa
#Declare all variations
	Declared moth variable as initial state = 0
	Declared total_inches variable as initial state = 0
	Declared rainfall variable as initial state = 0
#Input from user
	Ask user for number of years
#Iteration using the FOR lopp, executing each year statement by adding 1 to each year.
	For year in range (1, year +1)
#Iteration using the FOR loop, causing repetition structures until 13
	For month in range (1, 13)
#Declared the monthly_inches variable by taking input from user for 12 month rainfall data 
	Monthly_inches = float(input(“User will nter data: “)
#All the monthly_inches data entered by the user will be sum to the total_inches variable.
	Total_inches = total_inches + 1
#Calculate average of rainfall by dividing total_inches value by monthly_inches value.
	Rainfall_avg = total_inches / monthly_inches
#Display number of months, total inches, and the average using the the print tool
